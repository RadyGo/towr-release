Description: A light-weight, Eigen-based C++ library for trajectory optimization for legged robots.
 This library provides implementations for variables, costs and constraints that can be used to represent a legged locomotion problem. The resulting Nonlinear Programming Problem (NLP) can then be solved with off-the-shelf solvers, e.g. Ipopt using the generic optimizer interface ifopt.
